# What I learned

In this assignment I learned how to link an API and manipulate the data, which was a very challenging feat but now that I know how, I'm sure I will use this very valuable skill forever in my web development career. It made he have to look very closely for tiny details to build the URL; even one tiny symbol being missing calls nothing. Another challenge was linking the icons. I experimented with bootstrap which I have come to like a lot, it is very convenient for styling. I had some trouble with displaying the date on the cards and also with the list being able to re-search previous cities.
